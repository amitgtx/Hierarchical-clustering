# Hierarchical-clustering

Clustering is a process which partitions a given data set into homogenous groups based on given features such that similar objects are kept in a group whereas dissimilar objects are in different groups. It is the most important unsupervised learning problem. It deals with finding structure in a collection of unlabeled data. Hierarchical clustering involves creating clusters that have a predetermined ordering from top to bottom. For example, all files and folders on the hard disk are organized in a hierarchy. There are two types of hierarchical clustering, Divisive and Agglomerative.
